**Example: Optimizing Rackspace’s Rackspace Private Cloud Fleet for Performance and Reliability**


**Situation:** \n In my role at Rackspace, I led an initiative to improve the performance and reliability of the**Rackspace Private Cloud fleet**, which consisted of thousands of customer-deployed OpenStack private clouds across global datacenters. The challenge was that there wasn’t a single defined outcome—some customers prioritized performance, others cost efficiency, and others uptime.


**Task:** \n Create a**scalable, flexible optimization strategy** that improved overall fleet performance while accommodating different customer requirements.


**Action:**

* Conducted **fleet-wide telemetry analysis** to identify bottlenecks in CPU, memory, and storage performance.
* Developed a **tiered hardware refresh plan**, replacing underperforming legacy equipment while maintaining customer uptime.
* Implemented **automated performance tuning** via software updates and kernel optimizations across customer environments.
* Created a **change control process** to standardize updates, reducing ad-hoc, high-risk changes across the fleet.


**Result:**

* **Overall fleet performance improved by 20%**, with noticeable gains in storage IOPS and network throughput.
* **Reduced unplanned downtime by 35%** through better hardware lifecycle management and proactive replacements.
* **Cut operational costs by 15%** by right-sizing infrastructure based on workload demands rather than blanket upgrades.




Experience with Enterprise Datacenter equipment including Network devices, Servers, Storage appliances, and PDUs.


### **2. Experience with Enterprise Datacenter Equipment**

**Example: Managing Rackspace’s Backspace Fleet – Network, Compute, Storage, and Power Optimization**


**Situation:** \n As a leader in the **Rackspace Private Cloud team**, I was responsible for ensuring that customer OpenStack environments ran efficiently across **enterprise-grade datacenter infrastructure**. This included managing **network switches, storage appliances, servers, and PDUs** across multiple global locations.


**Task:** \n Optimize the **entire private cloud hardware stack** to improve performance, reduce power usage, and enhance customer experience.


**Action:**

* Worked with **hardware vendors** to evaluate the best server and storage configurations for OpenStack workloads.
  * We also worked with customers to ensure the hardware they were providing us met our certain standards. 
* Implemented **network improvements**, including **VXLAN overlays and optimized SDN configurations**, to improve inter-cloud communication.
* Worked across org to design **rack layouts and PDU load balancing** to optimize power distribution and prevent hotspots in high-density deployments.


**Result:**

* **Reduced power consumption** per rack by optimizing PDU and cooling configurations.
* **Increased overall storage performance**, improving IOPS for customer workloads.
* **Standardized hardware configurations**, making fleet-wide upgrades and replacements more predictable and cost-effective.
