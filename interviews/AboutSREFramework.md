**"Can you tell us about the SRE framework you developed?"**


Absolutely. When I joined **Frame.io (later acquired by Adobe),** the SRE function was still in its early stages, and we needed a more structured approach to **scalability, reliability, and operational excellence.** My goal was to implement a more **formalized SRE framework** that aligned with industry best practices while addressing the specific needs of our engineering teams and business objectives.

### **Key Components of the SRE Framework I Developed:**


1. **Reliability & Observability**
   * I introduced **service-level objectives (SLOs)**, **service-level indicators (SLIs)**, and **error budgets** to measure and improve reliability.
   * We enhanced **monitoring and observability** by integrating tools like **Datadog, Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry**, giving teams actionable insights into system health and performance.
2. **Incident Management & Operational Readiness**
   * I developed an **incident response process** based on **blameless postmortems** and **runbook automation**, reducing **MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution)** for critical incidents.
   * We established an **on-call rotation model with automation** to prevent alert fatigue and improve engineer experience.
3. **Automation & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   * We implemented **Terraform and Kubernetes** for scalable infrastructure management, reducing **manual provisioning** and increasing deployment speed.
   * CI/CD pipelines were enhanced to enable **progressive rollouts and automated rollbacks**, improving **release reliability**.
4. **Security & Compliance Integration**
   * Security was embedded into our processes with **DevSecOps principles**, including **automated compliance checks, policy-as-code, and vulnerability scanning** in the CI/CD pipeline.
   * We ensured our cloud environment complied with **FedRAMP, SOC 2, and NIST guidelines**, balancing security with operational agility.
5. **Culture & Cross-Team Collaboration**
   * I worked to bridge the gap between **SRE, Security, and Development teams** by advocating for a **“You Build It, You Run It”** culture.
   * Regular **reliability reviews and game days** were introduced to **proactively test failure scenarios** and improve system resilience.

### **Results & Impact:**

* Reduced **critical incident resolution time** by **over 40%**.
* Increased **deployment frequency** while reducing failure rates through **automated testing and progressive delivery**.
* Improved **system reliability and customer experience** through **proactive monitoring and automation**.
* Scaled the **SRE team from 2 to 11 engineers**, fostering a strong engineering culture and career growth.

This framework not only matured our **SRE practices** but also became a key driver in **Frame.io’s platform stability and growth at scale.** I’d be happy to dive deeper into any specific area you’re interested in.
