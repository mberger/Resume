One of my biggest professional achievements was leading the development and implementation of the **SRE framework** at **Frame.io**, especially as we scaled from a small startup to a larger, enterprise-level operation after the Adobe acquisition. When I joined the company, we had a small team, and the systems were in need of a more formalized approach to reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency. I took ownership of creating and maturing the SRE practices, focusing on **automation, incident management, observability**, and security. 


However, one of additional accomplishment was building a team culture that embraced both collaboration and accountability.


The framework we built not only helped to improve the **reliability of our platform** but also contributed to **reducing incident resolution time** by over 40%. We implemented **observability tools**, defined **SLOs**, and established a **robust incident response process**, which were key factors in ensuring that we could scale reliably while maintaining a great customer experience. Additionally, growing the SRE team from 2 engineers to 11 and managing a globally distributed team was a huge accomplishment in terms of both leadership and technical execution.


This achievement stands out to me because it not only involved technical expertise but also the ability to lead, influence cross-functional teams, and drive cultural change. It’s something I’m particularly proud of because it directly impacted the business by improving both **performance and customer satisfaction**, while also laying the foundation for continued growth and scalability.
