First, thank you for your time today—I know you’re incredibly busy, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you.


I’m Michael, a cybersecurity and cloud technology leader with over 25 years of experience driving innovation, reliability, and security in complex cloud environments. I most recently served as **Senior Manager of Site Reliability Engineering at Adobe**, where I led a globally distributed team, scaling it from **2 to 11 engineers** and implementing an **SRE framework** that improved reliability and operational efficiency. I came into Adobe as part of the **Frame.io acquisition**, and unfortunately, due to a recent reorganization, my position was eliminated in December.


I pride myself on being a **high achiever and results-driven leader** who thrives in fast-paced, evolving environments. Throughout my career, I’ve successfully built and led **cross-functional teams**, managed large-scale **cloud transformation projects**, and strengthened **security postures** for organizations by aligning **compliance frameworks like the NIST CSF, SOC II** with business goals. I have extensive experience working with **AWS and GCP**, as well as **Terraform** for automation, ~~all of which align well with this role.~~


What excites me about this opportunity at **Coalfire** is the chance to **leverage my cloud security, consulting, and leadership expertise** to help clients navigate complex cybersecurity challenges. I’m impressed by the company’s commitment to **thought leadership and innovation**, and I see tremendous potential to contribute my skills in **cloud architecture, project management, and client relationship building** to drive growth and success for both the company and its customers.


I’m confident that with my **technical depth, leadership experience, and client-focused approach**, I can add value to this team quickly and help elevate Coalfire’s cloud services practice. I’d love to be a part of this journey and make a meaningful impact.
