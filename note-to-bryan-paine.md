Note to Bryan Paine


Hi Bryan,

First, hope you’re well, and this isn’t too forward. I worked directly with Ammar Alim and Lauren Strope while they were at Frame.io  and both encouraged me to reach out directly to you. I wanted to express my interest in the Director, Security Partnerships position, or any other position you may have open in your org that may fit my background. My experience aligns closely with the role, and I believe I can bring exceptional value to the team’s mission.  Additionally, I am reaching out as my position was eliminated after a reorg and I would love to be able to stay at Adobe.

In my current role at Frame.io, I've led various efforts within Frame.io for integrating governance, risk, and compliance into infrastructure operations, maturing our internal security processes, and embedding reliability into our systems. I grew the SRE team from 2 to 11 members, including global talent, fostering a high performing culture of innovation and collaboration.

With over 25 years in technology leadership experience, I’ve consistently delivered risk reduction at scale. For example, at Rackspace, I implemented security strategies that spanned private cloud fleets, and at Scripps Networks (Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel etc), I built operations from the ground up with a focus on reliability, security and scalability. These roles honed my ability to build relationships with cross-functional teams, address systemic risks, and communicate security priorities effectively to both technical and executive audiences.

I’m particularly passionate about fostering a strong security culture and empowering teams to address both corporate and product security challenges. My technical foundation, from cloud infrastructure to DevSecOps practices, paired with my ability to translate technical metrics into compelling narratives, ensures I can navigate strategic conversations with stakeholders at all levels.

Given my track record and dedication to Adobe’s vision, I’m confident I can lead this team to identify and solve critical security problems across the organization. I’d love to discuss how I can contribute further to Adobe’s security partnerships.

Thank you for considering me for this opportunity!  I’m available to discuss at your convenience.

Having worked with the Security Partners team as a customer, I have firsthand insight into their mandate and how they engage with product teams to address security challenges. This experience has given me a clear understanding of their strengths and areas where we can enhance efficiency and impact. I already have actionable ideas on how to improve collaboration, streamline risk prioritization, and scale security outcomes to align with the organization’s broader goals.
