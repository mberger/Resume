**Dear Hiring Team at Brightcove,**

I'm excited to apply for the Director, Cloud Engineering and SRE position. With over 15 years of experience leading engineering teams and driving cloud-native solutions, I’ve built a career focused on reliability, scalability, and innovation—qualities that align perfectly with Brightcove's mission to deliver unparalleled video experiences.

In my current role at Adobe, I oversee cloud engineering and site reliability for Frame.io, a collaborative video review and workflow platform trusted by creators worldwide. Leading teams across geographies, I’ve implemented observability frameworks, streamlined CI/CD pipelines, and championed SRE principles to achieve five nines of reliability, even under demanding workloads. My hands-on leadership has ensured alignment between product engineering and operations, resulting in accelerated feature delivery without compromising quality.

Prior to Adobe, I played a pivotal role in scaling Frame.io’s cloud infrastructure on AWS, introducing chaos engineering practices and automating deployment processes to support rapid growth. My efforts included optimizing cost management and ensuring compliance with industry standards like PCI-DSS and GDPR—key considerations for a global platform like Brightcove's.

Beyond technology, I pride myself on cultivating inclusive, high-performing teams. I prioritize psychological safety, mentorship, and professional development, enabling engineers to innovate fearlessly while maintaining a culture of accountability. I also bring a strategic mindset to every initiative, from defining long-term roadmaps to influencing architecture and vendor decisions.

Brightcove’s vision to lead in streaming technology resonates deeply with my passion for crafting scalable, secure, and transformative digital platforms. I’m eager to bring my expertise in cloud engineering, SRE practices, and cross-functional collaboration to drive operational excellence and innovation for your customers.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience and vision can contribute to Brightcove’s continued success.

**Best regards,**
Michael Berger
